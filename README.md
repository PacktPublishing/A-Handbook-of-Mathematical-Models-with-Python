# A handbook of mathematical models with python


This book has been divided into three parts. 

Part I has 2 chapters and introduces the theory and concepts of mathematical modeling and discusses how a business problem can be formulated mathematically. 

Part II consists of 6 chapters (all have python code examples) about the most tried and tested tools that enable mathematical modeling and how mathematical models are complementary to machine learning models. 

Part III has 2 chapters (1 has python code examples) introduces the readers to optimization techniques in general, those used in machine learning and in operations research.
