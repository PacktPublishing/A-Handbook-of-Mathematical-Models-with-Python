# Implementing-Mathematical-Modelling-for-Machine-Learning

**Title subject to change 

This book has been divided into three parts. 

Part I discusses the theory and concepts of mathematical modeling and talks about how a business problem can be formulated mathematically. 

Part II consists of 6 chapters (3-8) about the most tried and tested tools that enable mathematical modeling and how it mathematical models are complementary to machine learning models. 

Part III introduces the readers briefly to optimization algorithms used in operations research and broadly to those used in machine learning.
