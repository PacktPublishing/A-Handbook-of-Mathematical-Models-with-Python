## What is this book about?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning projects as it helps in uncovering relationships and patterns and provides insights into structured and unstructured datasets. With various techniques and libraries available for performing EDA, choosing the right approach can sometimes bechallenging. This hands-on guide provides you with practical steps and ready-to-use code for conducting exploratory analysis on tabular, time series, and textual data.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Perform EDA with leading Python data visualization libraries
* Execute univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses on tabular data
* Uncover patterns and relationships within time series data
* Identify hidden patterns within textual data
* Discover different techniques to prepare data for analysis
* Overcome the challenge of outliers and missing values during data analysis
* Leverage automated EDA for fast and efficient analysis
